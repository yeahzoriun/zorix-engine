# heya'!, welcome to the zorixScript documentation! 👋<br>
*lets go through all the available functions, shall we?*<br>

# bind<br>
bind is the *MOST* important part of a zorixScript..<br>
it must be placed at the *VERY TOP* of each zorixScript with no fail, or else the script ⚠️ **WON'T WORK!** ⚠️!<br>

bind requires two arguments, "Type:" & "Id:"<br>
this is what "bind()" looks like in code!:<br>

bind(<br>
Type: "TextButton"<br>
Id: 2<br>
)<br>

bind basically tells the parser:<br>
"hey unc, i want you to instruct [X Binded Object]!!"<br>

and thats about it, now you can use the other functions! 🎊<br>

# setBackgroundColor<br>
setBackgroundColor is relatively self-explanatory, it sets the background color on *some* UI elements.<br>
it requires 3 un-labeled arguments that represent R/G/B values.<br>

this is what setBackgroundColor() looks like in code!:<br>

setBackgroundColor(<br>
255<br>
255<br>
255<br>
)<br>

the first value represents "R", second is "G", and third is "B".<br>

# But wait, whats up with the format?! 🤔<br>
The zorixscript parser is very simple, hence making it *VERY* picky in what formats work. the common rules are:<br>

> No indentation<br>
> Arguments *MUST* be passed in seperate lines<br>
> And other stuff i can't recall..<br>

okay lets resume..<br>

# setTextColor<br>
another self-explanatory one, this sets the text color on *some* UI elements!<br>
it requires 3 un-labeled arguments that represent R/G/B values.<br>

this is what setTextColor looks like in code!:<br>

setTextColor(<br>
0<br>
0<br>
0<br>
)<br>

the first value represents "R", second is "G", and third is "B".<br>

# setText<br>
this function sets (or changes) the text on *some* UI elements!<br>
it requires 1 un-labeled argument that represents a string!<br>

and here is what it looks like in code!:<br>

setText(<br>
"documentation text heh.."<br>
)<br>

# setPosition<br>
this sets (or changes) the position of *any* UI element.<br>
it requires 2 un-labeled arguments that represent X & Y values.<br>

here is the code example!:<br>

setPosition(<br>
50<br>
50<br>
)<br>

this sets the binded object to 50, 50 on the screen!<br>

# resize<br>
this resizes the size of *any* UI element.<br>
it requires 2 un-labeled arguments that represent W & H values.<br>

here is the code example!:<br>

resize(<br>
50<br>
50<br>
)<br>

this resizes the binded object to 50, 50 on the screen!<br>
